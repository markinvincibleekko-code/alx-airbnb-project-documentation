- JWT tokens used for session management
- OAuth provides alternative secure authentication

### Authorization

- Guests cannot access host-only features
- Hosts cannot access admin features
- Admin has elevated privileges

### Data Protection
- Payment information handled by external secure gateway
- Sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
